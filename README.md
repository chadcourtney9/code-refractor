# code-refractor
For this project, I was tasked to update this pages HTML and CSS to modern accessibility standards, while following semantic HTML guidelines. Also on both HTML and CSS pages, I added notitations throughout indicating what is being contatined in each section. 

# Resources
For resources, I primarily used stackoverflow forums. This helped guide me into using elements more fitting for each section throughout the page.

Here is a image of the final page!
